## Overview

The goal of this course is to review the C Programming language. The content of this course is based on the book 'The C Programming Language second edition' by Ritchie and Kernighan. I have made some changes to the code in order to have some fun and practice. 


## Content 

The content is part of the first chapter of the book, and it is labeled as follows: Chapter-Section-Exercise-Title.c
e.g. 1-2-1-FahrToCelcius.c
I will be uploading more code in the upcoming days, and adding some comments to the code for the sake of readability for anyone interested.
